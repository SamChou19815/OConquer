(** [Runner] defines how a Java program interacts with the main program. *)

(**
 * [compile_program class_name program_string] compiles a Java program with the
 * specified [class_name] and [program_string].
 * If it compiles, a compiled .class file will be generated and return true.
 * Otherwise, it will return false.
 *
 * Requires: [class_name] is the class name of a Java program and
 * [program_string] is its code.
 * @return: whether the program with the specified [class_name] compiles.
 * Effects: a valid .class file will be generated in the directory ./programs
 * if it compiles.

val compile_program : string -> string -> bool

(**
 * [get_value reader writer to_final_value class_name] obtains a value from a
 * Java program with name [class_name].
 * Getting the value is based on interactive IO between two programs, so the
 * user of this function is responsible for setting up a IO protocol for that.
 * The interaction allows the other program to query from values from the
 * host program and use those information to get the final output.
 *
 * Requires:
 * - [reader] is responsible for reading the input stream and parse that into
 *   a data structure that is later used. The data structure should be
 *   compatible both in the case of querying for data and in the case of
 *   outputing final result.
 * - [writer] is responsible for writing the query result based on the input
 *   given by the [reader]. The data structure given is guaranteed to be valid.
 *   Error is handled by this function.
 * - [to_final_value] maps an input object to Some final value, or [None] if the
 *   input is not a final value.
 * - [class_name] is the class name of a Java program. It should be compiled
 *   already.
 * @return: the result of the running the program.
