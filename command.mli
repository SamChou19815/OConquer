   * [get_mil_unit pos] returns the military unit at the given position [pos].

   * Requires: [pos] is a legal representation of position.
   * Returns: [Some m] where [m] is a military unit if [m] is at [pos]; [None]

   * [get_tile pos] returns the tile at the given position [pos].
   * The tile may or may not exist.

   * Requires: [pos] is a legal representation of position.
   * Returns: [Some t] where [t] is a tile if there exists a tile at pos; [None]

   * Requires: [mil_unit] is a legal military unit.
   * Returns: [Some pos] where [pos] is the position of the military unit;

(**
 * [from_string program_str] parses a string [program_str] into a program AST.
 * If the [program_str] is not a legal program, [None] will be returned;
 * otherwise, [Some p] is returned, where [p] is a parsed legal AST.
 *
 * Requires: [string] can be any string.
 * Returns: [Some p] where [p] is the AST of the program is [program_str] is
 * well-formed; [None] if the program is illegal.
