 * information about a military unit.

 * Requires:
 * - [mil_unit] must be a legal military unit that is at [pos]. If it's not
 *   supplied, it defaults to [None].
 * - [pos] must be a legal, in-bound position.
 * - [tile] can be any tile, but it must corresponds to the [pos].
 * @return a [map_content] object that contains all the aforementioned info.

 * and a function [f] that maps each item to a [map_content].
 *
 * Requires:
 * - [f] should correctly converts an object to a map_record.
 * - [lst] should contain a list of things that fits the meaning of map content.

 * round.

 * Requires:

 * - [l] is a legal [diff_logs].
 * @return the updated diff logs with the new [r] appended to the end.
